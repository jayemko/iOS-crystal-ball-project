Crystal Ball Project
========================

This simple app introduced the Objective-C language, Xcode, and some very basic concepts in the iOS SDK. By the end, I learned how to build a simple iPhone app that responds to touch and motion events with a nice animation.

- completed via Team Treehouse tutorial "Build a Simple iPhone App."
